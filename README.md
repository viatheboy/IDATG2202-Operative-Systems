The repository consists of several tasks done in the course. All the tasks are designed to solve small problems, not larger assignments.
It also has a folder that holds smaller tasks, that were not compulsory. 
<br>Task descriptions are not available if not specified in the files. <br>
A decent amount of the task done in this course was done on a Linux VM, which I did not store locally. 

Course teaches machine and operating system processes such as concurrency, including locks and semaphores. Memory management algorithms and design problems. File system handling, HDD/SSD mechanisms, caching, among other things.
